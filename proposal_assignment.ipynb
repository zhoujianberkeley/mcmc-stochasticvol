    "The main deliverable for the second quarter of the computational economics and finance class is a project to showcase what you have learned. The goal of this project is for you (potentially in a small group) to produce a piece of work (in the form of a Jupyter notebook) that you would be able to use to showcase the skills that you have learned in this class to potential employers or academic advisors.\n",

    "The relatively loose structure in self-directed projects like this makes them a bit more challenging than other things that you will do in school, but we think it also makes them more interesting. They give you a chance to indulge your curiosity and show off your creativity.\n",

    "We have broken the project into three components to keep you on track. Each of these components should be turned in as its own Jupyter notebook. The first two steps are graded almost entirely on whether you do them or not. You must complete the first two steps on your own. When you actually begin working on the final project, you may work in groups of two to four, but you may also work alone if you’d  prefer."
